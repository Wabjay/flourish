At Phoenix Court, Rebekah was responsible for building the group’s finance function and led on key projects to operationalise their processes. </p>

Through working with Basecamp fund managers (GPs), she gained a deep understanding of the pain points GPs face in their earliest days. She also identified opportunities to make a significant impact by partnering with GPs on the nuances of operating a fund and building best-in-class operations from funds I, II, III, IV, and beyond.</p>
  <p class="text-16 text-grey-6 tablet:text-20 laptop:text-32">Previously, Rebekah was Head of Finance at the FTSE 250 private equity fund ICG Enterprise Trust, after being promoted within the FTSE 100 asset manager ICG. There, she honed her skills in fund structuring and operations, collaborating with legal and tax advisors on innovative structures.

She holds degrees in Law and Economics and was the only graduate from her graduating class with both degrees!</p>
