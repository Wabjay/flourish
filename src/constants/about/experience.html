        <p class="text-16 text-grey-6 tablet:text-20 laptop:text-32">Rebekah was most recently Partner & Head of Finance at Phoenix Court, home to Localglobe, EMEAs leading venture capital fund. At Phoenix Court, Rebekah was responsible for building the group’s finance function and led on key projects to operationalise their processes at scale. Rebekah also held the Groups Senior Management Function 17 (MLRO) with the FCA.</p>
        <p class="text-16 text-grey-6 tablet:text-20 laptop:text-32">One of the group's four core strategies is Basecamp, a fund of funds program focused on investing in first-time emerging managers, with a portfolio boasting over 60 managers globally. Through working with Basecamp fund managers (GPs), Rebekah gained a deep understanding of the pain points GPs face in their earliest days. She identified opportunities to make a significant impact by partnering with GPs on the nuances of operating a fund and building best-in-class operations from funds I, II, III, IV, and beyond.</p>
        <p class="text-16 text-grey-6 tablet:text-20 laptop:text-32">Prior to Phoenix Court, Rebekah was Head of Finance at the FTSE 250 private equity fund of fund ICG Enterprise Trust, following an internal promotion from within the $75bn aum FTSE 100 asset manager ICG. There, she honed her skills in fund structuring and operations, collaborating with legal and tax advisors on innovative structures, from strategies seeded from the Groups balance sheet. Being a senior finance lead of a listed asset manager, she developed expertise around compliance, governance and oversight.</p>
        <p class="text-16 text-grey-6 tablet:text-20 laptop:text-32">Rebekah is a Fellow Chartered Accountant, having spent six years with KPMG and worked at banks like HSBC. She holds degrees in Law and Economics and was the only graduate from her graduating class with both degrees!</p>
        <p class="text-16 text-grey-6 tablet:text-20 laptop:text-32"> Outside of finance, Rebekah enjoys hiking, gymnastics, photography and travel. Rebekah has great ambitions to visit every country in the world — tracking strong at close to 80. She is a proud trustee of Music Masters, which enables classical music to be accessible to underrepresented children, and Peut-Être, a children's theatre creating early dance-theatre experiences for all children.</p>
